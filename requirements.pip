#- NOTE: django-syntax-colorize isn't installed via pip b/c it doesn't have
#        a setup.py so it won't install this way.
#        - Not a big deal b/c we can easily 'install' it by moving
#          syntax_color.py to our templatetags directory
#        - Thus, this file will have to be committed.
